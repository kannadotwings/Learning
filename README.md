/server      -> Express backend
/uploads     -> Uploaded images
README.md
```

## Features

- React frontend with Bootstrap UI
- Express backend with Sequelize ORM (or Mongoose if MongoDB)
- Multer for image uploads
- Product management (add, edit, view, list)
- Axios API integration
- Environment configuration with `.env`

## Tech Stack

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Express)
```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # configure DB connection & PORT
npm run dev           # start Express (e.g., port 5000)
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start             # start React (e.g., port 3000)
```

## Image Upload (Multer)

- Upload folder: `/server/uploads/products`
- Only image filenames are saved (e.g., `image.jpg`)
- Access images at:
```
IMAGE_URL = http://localhost:5000/uploads/products/image.jpg
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint               | Description               |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/products/create` | Create product            |
| GET    | `/api/products/:id`    | View product by ID        |
| PUT    | `/api/products/:id`    | Update product            |
| GET    | `/api/products`        | List all products         |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id`    | Delete product by ID      |

## Production Build

### Build React
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Serve React with Express
Add to `server/index.js`:
```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/build')));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '../client/build', 'index.html'));
});
```

## Notes

- Add `.env` for both client & server
- Handle CORS for API requests
- Form validation using Formik + Yup
